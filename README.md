# DevOps Pipeline Implementation
### This project illustrates the implementation of a successfull CI-CD pipeline using various Devops Tools and Platforms Like AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Github.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup & Security

1. **Create Separate Network Environments for Privacy, Isolation, and Security**
   - **Create and manage VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**:
     - Set up a **VPC** to ensure your cloud network is isolated from others.
     - Configure it with public and private subnets as needed.
     - Use **CIDR blocks** for IP address allocation and design the network topology.
   - **Create and manage Security Groups**:
     - Create **Security Groups** for controlling traffic.
     - Define **inbound** (incoming) rules that specify which ports, protocols, and IP ranges can access your instances.
     - **Best practices**: Restrict access to only trusted IPs, open ports only for required services (e.g., SSH for management, HTTP/HTTPS for web access).
   - **Create Instances for Kubernetes Cluster**:
     - Launch 3 **VM instances** (e.g., EC2 in AWS) for your Kubernetes cluster.
     - **Configure instance types** based on resource requirements (e.g., `t2.medium` for testing, larger instances for production).
     - Install **Kubernetes** on these instances (either manually or use a managed service like **EKS**).

2. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**
   - Set up a **Kubernetes cluster** to orchestrate your application deployments.
   - Use **Kubeadm** to initialize your cluster or use a managed Kubernetes service (e.g., **AWS EKS**, **Google GKE**).
   - Implement **security scans** for vulnerabilities on the cluster using tools like **Kube-hunter**, **Kube-bench**, or integration with **SonarQube** for static analysis.

3. **Create Multiple VMs for Supporting Tools**
   - **SonarQube**: For static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.
   - **Nexus**: For managing artifacts, such as container images, JARs, and other build outputs.
   - **Jenkins**: For automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.
   - **Monitoring**: Set up a VM for monitoring tools (e.g., **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **ELK Stack**).

## Phase 2: Version Control & Source Code Management

1. **Create Git Repository**
   - Create a **private Git repository** (using **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**).
   - Make sure to enable **branch protection rules** for ensuring security and code quality in production branches (e.g., main, master).

2. **Push Source Code**
   - Push your **source code** to the Git repository.
   - Make sure to include proper `.gitignore` files to avoid pushing sensitive or unnecessary files.
   - **Best practices**: Use a structured branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow or trunk-based development).

3. **Make Source Code Visible**
   - Ensure proper **access control** so only authorized users can view or modify the repository.
   - Set up **CI/CD integration** to trigger builds and deployments automatically whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

## Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

1. **Build the CI/CD Pipeline**
   - **Jenkins Setup**: Use **Jenkins** for creating automated pipelines.
     - Set up Jenkins to trigger builds on source code changes (from Git).
     - Configure **build tools** (e.g., **Maven**, **Gradle**, **Docker**).
     - Create a **Docker image** for your application (if applicable).
     - Use **Kubernetes Deployments** to manage application containers.

2. **Security Measures in CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Integrate **security scanning** tools in the pipeline (e.g., **SonarQube** for static analysis, **OWASP Dependency Check** for dependencies).
   - Perform **automated tests** (unit, integration, security) to ensure code quality and security before deployment.
   - **Best practices**: Integrate **secrets management** (e.g., **Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager**) to manage sensitive data securely in your pipeline.

3. **Deployment**
   - Set up automated **deployment** to Kubernetes using **Helm** or Kubernetes manifests.
   - Deploy the application to your **Kubernetes cluster** after passing tests.
   - Use **rolling updates** and **blue-green deployment** strategies for minimal downtime.

4. **Mail Notifications**
   - Implement **email notifications** for build status and deployment results.
   - Use Jenkins plugins like **Email Extension Plugin** to send notifications for successful builds, failed builds, or deployments.
   - Optionally, integrate with **Slack**, **Teams**, or **other messaging services** for real-time notifications.

## Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability

1. **Set Up Monitoring Tools**
   - **System-Level Monitoring**: Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor system metrics like CPU, RAM usage, disk space, etc.
     - Install **Prometheus** on each VM or use a managed Prometheus service.
     - Create **Grafana dashboards** for visualization.
   - **Website/Application-Level Monitoring**: Monitor your applicationâ€™s health and traffic.
     - Use tools like **Prometheus + Kubernetes Metrics Server** or **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
     - Set up **alerts** for high traffic, downtime, or any errors in the application.

2. **Set Up Alerts and Dashboards**
   - Set up **Prometheus Alertmanager** or **Grafana Alerts** to trigger notifications (via email, Slack, etc.) in case of system failures, high resource usage, or other critical issues.
   - Use **Grafana dashboards** to track the overall health of your application, system resources, and Kubernetes nodes.
